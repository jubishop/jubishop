### Hi, I'm jubi 👋

I’m an engineer, a gamer, a husband, and a father.  

- 🤖  I currently work as a Software Engineer at Google where I'm working to improve a performance testing framework, parts of which are open-sourced as [Mako](https://github.com/google/mako).
- 🎮  My hobby projects at the moment include [TuskBot](http://jubishop.com/TuskBot/), [Custom Rocket League Maps](https://steamcommunity.com/id/jubishop/myworkshopfiles/), and starting my own [Blog](http://artisanalsoftware.com).
- 🤓  For fun I'm learning Unreal Engine, Jekyll, and CSS.
- 💬  Ask me about Ruby, Rocket League, and making Discord bots.
- 📫  You can reach me at: me@jubishop.com
- ⛺️  From 30 to 37 years old I took off work to travel, remodel an old home, do a ton of hiking, and start my family.
